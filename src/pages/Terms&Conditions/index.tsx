        <ul>
          <li><strong>1.</strong> We will ensure that our Services are provided with reasonable care and skill and in accordance with best trade practice. Our Services, and any guidance we provide, will be from an interior design perspective only; you must gain specialist advice from architects, building control, structural engineers or other specialist contractors or trades where applicable.</li>
          <li><strong>2.</strong> For our Design Services, we will provide you with a number of designs which will need to be approved by you in writing. We will accommodate a maximum of two revisions to your chosen design. Any further alterations, any changes to the original brief, any changes required after you have approved the design, works required outside of our normal working hours (Monday to Friday, 10am – 6.30 pm excluding public holidays) or any additional visits required above the allowance included for in our Proposal will be chargeable at per day basis. Once 3D render creation stage begins, after prior approval and consent, it can no longer be subject to alteration.</li>
          <li><strong>3.</strong> If you require any additional services after accepting our Proposal, we will provide you with a further Proposal, which must be accepted by you in writing before we will proceed.</li>
          <li><strong>4.</strong> We may provide sketches or impressions before or during the provision of the Services. Any such material is intended for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to provide an exact specification of the works to be provided, nor to guarantee specific results and is not to be used for construction purposes unless specifically issued as such.</li>
          <li><strong>5.</strong> Design packages are not subject to negotiations as all packages are carefully designed keeping our clients in mind.</li>
          <li><strong>6.</strong> Design packages are not inclusive of supervision and execution. We will be happy to help with coordination via phone calls.</li>
          <li><strong>7.</strong> Design packages are built mainly keeping in mind the need of clients who want detailed drawings and can manage execution on their own.</li>
          <li><strong>8.</strong> Detailed drawings and 3D renders are customised as per the clients need and hence take a minimum of 7-10 days to reach completion.</li>
          <li><strong>9.</strong> It is your responsibility to check all dimensions and measurements set out in any plans we provide, and it is the builder or contractor’s responsibility to report any discrepancies to us prior to any construction or building work starting.</li>
          <li><strong>10.</strong> If we are asked to provide lighting, heating, flooring, or other plans, we will produce these as guidance only from a design point of view. It will be the relevant contractor’s responsibility to ensure the work from the plans we have created is safe and practical.</li>
          <li><strong>11.</strong> We will provide our designs and plans digitally and have included for this in our Proposal. If you require printed materials, we will charge for our costs in providing these.</li>
          <li><strong>12.</strong> We may provide suggestions for products or other services to be provided as part of your project. You are under no obligation to accept these suggestions but if you decide to, you will need to ensure the relevant supplier is suitable for your needs. A separate contractual relationship will be created between you and the supplier, under separate terms and conditions. You will be responsible for making arrangements and paying the supplier directly and they will be liable to you directly for their actions or inactions.</li>
          <li><strong>13.</strong> We may agree to coordinate the ordering of products for your design. We cannot be held responsible for arranging repairs, replacements, returns or freight claims for purchases you have made. We strive to select furniture and accessories and brands with good reputations; however, will not be held responsible for the quality of any furniture or accessory that we select or propose.</li>
          <li><strong>14.</strong> We will not be liable for any failure or delay in performing our obligations where that failure or delay results from any cause that is beyond our reasonable control. Such causes include, but are not limited to: power failure, internet service provider failure, industrial action, civil unrest, fire, flood, storms, earthquakes, acts of terrorism or war, governmental action, epidemic or other natural disaster, or any other event that is beyond our control.</li>
          <li><strong>15.</strong> We will use our own exclusive judgement when deciding upon artistic factors required for the provision of the Services. To the extent permissible by law, we will not accept liability, and no refunds will be offered, in the unlikely event that you are dissatisfied due to a matter of personal taste.</li>
          <li><strong>16.</strong> We always welcome feedback from our clients and, whilst we always use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that your experience as a client of ours is a positive one, we nevertheless want to hear from you if you have any cause for complaint.</li>
          <li><strong>17.</strong> If you wish to complain about any aspect of your dealings with us, please contact us in writing in the first instance. We will respond to your complaint within 14 days.</li>
          <li><strong>18.</strong> We cannot be held responsible for issues or defects in our Services where we have relied on information provided by you or other companies instructed by you.</li>
